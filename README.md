To preview the site with all animations and page transitions:

1. Make sure Node.js is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project root folder.
3. Run: npm install
4. Then: npm run start
5. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

If you open index.html directly in a browser without using npm run start,
the animations and dynamic page switching will not work as expected.
